# datavalanche

The goal of this project is to cross avalanche data with meteorological data and see whether this data confirms known models of avalanche risk estimation. Once this analysis is performed the project will be continued by either providing some intuitive visualisation of the data for preventive and educational purpose or trying to apply machine learning techniques in order to improve estimations of the avalanche risk.

# Abstract

The goal of our project is to highlight the causes of avalanches which kill around 30 people per year in Switzerland.
To do so we plan to use [public data](www.slf.ch/praevention/lawinenunfaelle/index_EN) on mortal avalanche accidents
available on the Schnee- und Lawinenforschung's website.

The next step would be to join this data with meteo data from
the few days preceding an accident as the weather plays a major role in the formation of fragile snow layers.

Once the data is collected and pre-processed the project could follow two directions:

- Apply machine learning techniques in order to improve avalanche risk prediction
- Build an interactive visualisation of our data to sensitize people to avalanche risk

# Data description
_(All the data mentionned in this section is referenced in the links above)_
  * Avalanche data from the Swiss Avalanche Foundation. Contains entries for every fatal avalanche in the last 20 years (359 avalanches). Contains the date, location, starting point, elevation, activity (e.g. off-piste skiing), victims, and danger-level that day.
  * Avalanche data from [data-avalanche.org](http://www.data-avalanche.org/)
  * Meteo data from [ECMWF](http://apps.ecmwf.int/datasets/)
  * Meteorological data might be slightly harder: the HISTALP data looked promising, however Switzerland is not a part of it, and it's only monthly data anyways. The Meteoswiss website is very confusing. There is some stuff on opendata.swiss, which in the end links to this: http://data.geo.admin.ch/ which isn't the clearest organisation either. Maybe we should directly contact Meteoswiss? I found this: data.geo.admin.ch/ch.meteoschweiz.swissmetnet/VQHA69.csv it is the data from all the swiss stations at 15:50 today (at least when I checked). How do we get all the data?

# Feasibility and Risks

Meteo data seems a bit challenging to obtain and process. In case this part should not work we can still work on useful
visualisation with the already available information such as location, altitude, orientation, avalache risk, time of day,
date. Moreover less fine grained data could be easier to find and process but only gives an estimation on the total amount
of snow. Finally not using meteo data could allow us to use avalanche data from multiple sources as we will have more time
to combine it.
