# datavalanche

The goal of this project is to cross avalanche data with meteorological data and see whether this data confirms known models of
avalanche risk estimation. Once this analysis is performed the project will be continued by either providing some intuitive
visualisation of the data for preventive and educational purpose or trying to apply machine learning technique in order to
improve estimations of the avalanche risk.
