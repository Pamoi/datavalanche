# datavalanche

The goal of this project is to cross avalanche data with meteorological data and see whether this data confirms known models of avalanche risk estimation. Once this analysis is performed the project will be continued by either providing some intuitive visualisation of the data for preventive and educational purpose or trying to apply machine learning techniques in order to improve estimations of the avalanche risk.

# Abstract



# Data description
_(All the data mentionned in this section is referenced in the links above)_
  * Avalanche data from the Swiss Avalanche Foundation. Contains entries for every fatal avalanche in the last 20 years (359 avalanches). Contains the date, location, starting point, elevation, activity (e.g. off-piste skiing), victims, and danger-level that day.
  * Meteorological data might be slightly harder: the HISTALP data looked promising, however Switzerland is not a part of it, and it's only monthly data anyways. The Meteoswiss website is very confusing. There is some stuff on opendata.swiss, which in the end links to this: http://data.geo.admin.ch/ which isn't the clearest organisation either. Maybe we should directly contact Meteoswiss? I found this: data.geo.admin.ch/ch.meteoschweiz.swissmetnet/VQHA69.csv it is the data from all the swiss stations at 15:50 today (at least when I checked). How do we get all the data?

# Feasibility and Risks
Really depends on our ability to get meteo data. I guess Meteoswiss might agree to collaborate? If that's not the case, then we might be at a dead end.
